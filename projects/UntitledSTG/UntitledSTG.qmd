"Untitled "S"hoo"T"ing "G"ame"

Engine: Shooting Game Builder

Barely made past through the planning stage due to schedule conflicts and pursuing other passions. TL;DR: it was basically "what if Infinite Stratos (yes, that mediocre anime) were planes instead.

Concept Renders drawn by yours truly (yes, they are kind of awful.):

![Crimson Lotus - the default 1P ship. Pretty generic.](images/CrimsonLotusPlaceholder.png)

![Azure Cyanus - The 2P ship. It was made to be a derivative of Crimson Lotus because I don't know if STG Builder can handle two players at once.](images/AzureCyanusPlaceholder.png)

![Winged Dragoon - The heavy hitter. Moves slow, but packs a punch.](images/WingedDragoonPlaceholder.png)
Sprites:

![Big Zako - It was too big to be a common enemy... sort of.](images/BigZako-Sheet.png)

![Yes, the resolution of the game was THAT small. How can you tell?](images/Aseprite.png)

![Ditto.](images/Aseprite2.png)
