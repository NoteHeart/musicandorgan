I might get back to this later or something, but don’t count on it. TL;DR: it was basically “what if Infinite Stratos (yes, that mediocre anime) were planes instead.” It probably would’ve been similar to Ace Combat or something due to the fact that Ace Combat 3 literally takes place in the future lmao.\nConcept Renders drawn by yours truly (yes, they are kind of awful.):\n\n\n\nCrimson Lotus - the default 1P ship. Pretty generic. I think I crossed an F-22A Raptor over with Azuma from Raiden V. It ended up looking more like an F-14A Tomcat with a single tail wing haha.\n\n\n\n\n\nAzure Cyanus - The 2P ship. It was made to be a derivative of Crimson Lotus because I don’t know if STG Builder can handle two players at once.\n\n\n\n\n\nWinged Dragoon - The heavy hitter. Moves slow, but packs a punch. Yes, this kind of design exists in real life. Search up the “de Havilland Sea Vixen” if you think I’m joking.\n\n\nSprites:\n\n\n\nBig Zako - It was too big to be a common enemy… sort of.\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, the resolution of the game was THAT small. How can you tell?\n\n\n\n\n\nDitto.\n\n\nAnd just for fun, I decided to give the faceless pilots a bit of a personality as well (I think at that time, every nation was redacted because I didn’t know if I should 1. set the story in the real world far into the future, or 2. make a new world akin to Strangereal.):\n\n\n\nFun fact: This guy’s callsign is a reference to Houki Shinonono from Infinite Stratos. Yes, her name is literally “Broom” in Japanese. Look, I don’t know, okay?\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel like this would be “easy” to model in blender, PSX style. I think the callsign “Brash Head” was kind of the fact that Winged Dragoon was meant to be for gun nuts. (turrets go “BRRRRRRRRRRRRR”.)"
