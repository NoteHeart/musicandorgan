Pretty generic.\n\n\n\n\n\nAzure Cyanus - The 2P ship. It was made to be a derivative of Crimson Lotus because I don’t know if STG Builder can handle two players at once.\n\n\n Sprites:\n\n\n\nBig Zako - It was too big to be a common enemy… sort of.\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, the resolution of the game was THAT small. How can you tell?\n\n\n\n\n\nDitto."
